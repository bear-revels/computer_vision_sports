The intention of this test case is to see how you would handle certain problems and which parts you will give priority.
It is important that you also code your solution and not only reason about it. Both are equally important. We know this task is too big for you to finish within the time.

You are provided video footage and tracking data (of the same game, but not the exact same moment). At TrackBox both computer vision and data analysis are very important parts of our product. That is why we provide you both video and data. Keep in mind that all the data we have, is extracted out of video as it is our only source data.

Your goal is to create an algorithm to find similar moments in the gameplay. This can be labeled moments like goals or corners, but also moments that do not have a label. Maybe a team performs a similar tactic multiple times during a game. This could also be such a moment.
The whole process would consists of extracting information out of the image and then trying to use it to find these similar moments.

You may use whatever you want/need, there are no restrictions.

Data is available here: test case
Both videos are the same moment (one is 3 min and one is 5 min, of which the first 3 min are the same as the first video).
